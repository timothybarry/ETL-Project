###Project Proposal

Project Title: ETL - Dog Intelligence v. Dog Heterozygosity

Team Members: Gilbert Duenas, Tim Barry and Molly Perlich

Project Description:

   In this project, we intend to extract and transform three datasets. 
      1) dog_intelligence.csv
      2) Heterozygosity_breeds.csv
      3) Expected_Heterozygosity_breeds.csv

   We will then type of transform our data by cleaning the data types for consistency and then joining the data sets. 
   
   We will load the data into a relaitonal production base (SQL database) for future analysis. Finally, we conclude the project with a final tecnical report which will further describe the project's process.
